This module intends to be your best tool to manipulate
every kind of Perl complex data structure.
When using Perl with complex data structure (see man perldsc),
you enter the world of Perl structure which is just powerfull
(no limitation on heterogeneous type, no limitation on size and quite simple)
Here you have the essentials functions :
compare, navigate and applying patch (for modifying).
