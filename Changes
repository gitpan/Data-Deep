0.07
	- change argument call ref to array in internal &$matchPath() and &$isKey()

	- header changed for rt.cpan.org giving an error 
	(thanks to Thomas Sibley and David Muir Sharnoff)
	- DISABLED function : complex key compare (to use o_key as nodes priority searching)

0.08
	Bug #83259 : https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=83259
	=> function _escape_path removed as it is useless

0.09	remove space after \ in reference to hash or arry in deep.t test	

0.10 dim.  9 juin 2013 11:01:26
	deep.t : compare loop (for(0..1) removed) for clearest view on errors related to tests in both complex or not (o_complex)
	also add warn if failure occurs instead of keeping in debug mode (o_debug/bug) which is verbose and not helping for FAILS tests

0.11 
	add argument of the visitor for open/closing ARRAY/HASH in travel() crossing
	travel() results append using internal function __appendVisitorResult()
	quotation from " to ' modification in patch text format
	Key optimisation :
	   - Key usage is used in Text patch format and removed from Dom (previous $isKey() computations search/compare/travel ...)
	   - correct DomPatch2Text() & TextPatch2Dom() for Key handling
	add public functions patternDom2Text() & patternText2Dom() (redesigned from previous internal function)

0.12    Warning purify
